"""
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.
One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list
of happy numbers up to 1000.
(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number.)
